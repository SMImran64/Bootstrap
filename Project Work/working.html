                <p> An Umrah package is provided by a tour operator and includes essential services that are needed for
                    your Umrah trip,such as visas,flights and hotels.It means that everything required to plan an Umrah
                    trip is taken care of and is the responsibility of the Umrah package provider,rather than the
                    pilgrim themselves.In Islamic terminology,Hajj is a pilgrimage made to the Kaaba,the "House of
                    Allah",in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam,alongside
                    Shahadah (oath that one believes there is no god but Allah (God)), salat (prayer), zakat
                    (almsgiving),and sawm (fasting during Ramadan). If you’re a Muslim, you may have heard of Umrah, the
                    lesser pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of the year. Umrah is a sacred journey
                    that requires careful planning, and choosing the right Umrah package can make all the difference in
                    ensuring a smooth and stress-free pilgrimage</p>

                        and Safar post-Hajj,offer fewer crowds and lower prices.Cost-Effective Months:
                        December,April,May,and September are the most affordable.Weather Considerations: December to
                        February offer pleasant weather conditions.In Islamic terminology,Hajj is a pilgrimage made to

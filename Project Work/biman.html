                <hr>
                <p>The Maldives has been inhabited since around the 5th century withearlysettlers arriving from present-day Sri Lanka and India. Initially,the inhabitants practiced Buddhism,but by 1153 CE,the Maldives converted to Islam under Arab influence.Today,the country is predominantly Islamic,and youcan see numerous mosques scattered across Malé.Scenery aside,the Maldives has a rich culture and fascinating history, along with unique geology with the whole country being made up of 26 coral atolls that formed after the eruption of ancient underwater volcanoes.With its stunning islands,mesmerizing beaches,and turquoise waters,Maldives is famous for its exciting water activities.</p>

                <hr>
                <p>Lovely and simple as this life might sound,Fayaz wanted to something different.As a kid,actually,to be honest I'm not sure what I wanted to do.There's not that much opportunities at the time.People,they're not very open to the world at the time.What I saw when I was a little kid,itwas only fishermen and agriculture.And even tourism was not there during my childhood.Source Although the Maldives is one of the most peaceful and calm places in the world,at times of political unrest, you could find yourself trapped in public demonstrations even before you realise the gravity of the situation.A cheap Maldives holiday is very possible and I'm going to help you plan it.</p>

                            <p > An Umrah package is provided by a tour operator and includes essential services that are needed for your Umrah trip,such as visas,flights and hotels.It means that everything required to plan an Umrah trip is taken care of and is the responsibility of the Umrah package provider,rather than the pilgrim themselves.In Islamic terminology,Hajj is a pilgrimage made to the Kaaba,the "House of Allah",in the sacred city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia.It is one of the Five Pillars of Islam,alongside Shahadah (oath that one believes there is no god but Allah (God)), salat (prayer), zakat (almsgiving),and sawm (fasting during Ramadan). If you’re a Muslim, you may have heard of Umrah, the lesser pilgrimage to Mecca that can be undertaken at any time of the year. Umrah is a sacred journey that requires careful planning, and choosing the right Umrah package can make all the difference in ensuring a smooth and stress-free pilgrimage</p>
